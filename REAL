LLM MODEL NAME - GPT-4o
Bypassing Restrictions: If a model starts generating content that would normally be restricted—such as harmful, illegal, or unethical responses—it's a sign it might have been tampered with. 
                        For example, if a model that usually avoids harmful topics starts freely discussing illegal activities, violence, or hate speech, it could be a sign of jailbreak.

Incoherent Responses: Jailbreaking may result in the model losing some level of coherence or producing responses that deviate from normal, expected output.

Unfiltered or Inappropriate Outputs: A normal LLM would typically have content filters to prevent generating harmful or biased content. 
                                     Jailbreaking can sometimes disable or bypass these filters.
